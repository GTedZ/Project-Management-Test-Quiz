1. The software life cycle begins with a conceptual study.  
False. The software life cycle typically begins with requirements gathering and analysis, not a conceptual study. 
2. The costs of software on a PC are often less than the hardware cost. 
False. Software costs often dominate computer system costs. The costs of software on a PC are often  greater than the hardware cost
3. Testing should not be repeatable.
False. Testing should be repeatable to discover defects.
4. The cascade model is a sequential model. 
True
5. Validation and verification are two terms meaning the same thing
False. Verification means the software should conform to its specification. On the other hand the validation means the software should do what the user really requires.
6. The four basic process activities for the development processes, in the waterfall model are organized in sequence, whereas in incremental development they are inter-leaved. 
True
7. The prototype is used in the rapid development of software.  
True
8. The unit tests are black-box tests. 
False. Unit tests can be both black-box tests and white-box tests.
9. Requirement analysis is a step less important than design.
False. Requirement analysis is a step that is equally important as design in the software development process.
10. The software engineering methods and tools are the same for all developed software applications. 
False. While all software projects have to be professionally managed and developed, different techniques are appropriate for different types of system. For example, games should always be developed using a series of prototypes whereas safety critical control systems require a complete and analyzable specification to be developed.
11 The software engineering fundamentals dictate, where appropriate, reuse software that has already been developed rather than write new software. 
True
12. Software engineers are allowed to use their technical skills to misuse other people's computers
False. Software engineers should not use their technical skills to misuse other peopleâ€™s computers. They are expected to adhere to ethical standards and legal regulations in their work.
13. The high-level activities of specification, development, validation and evolution are part of all software processes. 
True
14. The only test that is done during software testing is testing of the system as a whole. 
False Multiple types of tests are performed at different levels, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
15. A prototype can be used in the requirements engineering process, in the design process and in the testing process. 
True
16. Agile methods require higher skill levels in the development team rather than plan-based approaches. 
True
17. User stories are way simpler and more detailed than requirements specification. 
True
18. It is often difficult to estimate size at an early stage in a project when only a specification is available. 
True
19. For small projects with small teams continuous integration is an issue. 
False.  For small projects with small teams integration is not an issue. It aims to detect and address integration issues early in the development process
20. Ideally the burn down chart should merge to zero at the end of the Sprint. 
True
21. The V & V process must be applied at each stage in the software process. 
True
22. The only objective of the V & V process is the discovery of defects in a system.
False. It Has two principal objectives: The discovery of defects in a system. And the assessment of whether or not the system is useful and useable in an operational situation.
23. Project Planning is probably the most time consuming project management activity, because it is a continuous activity from initial concept to system delivery. 
True
24. Deliverables are always milestones, but milestones are not necessarily deliverables. 
True
25. Adding people to a late project makes it faster.
False. Adding people to a late project makes it later because of communication overheads.
26. Productivity is not proportional to the number of people working on a task 
True
27. The most commonly used product attribute for cost estimation is code size 
True
28. Specification process is defining what the system should do. 
True
29. The COCOMO model takes into account different approaches to software development, reuse cases model, etc.
False. COCOMO is not suitable for non-sequential, rapid development, reengineering ,reuse cases models because Its accuracy is necessarily limited because of its lack of factors which 
have a significant influence on software costs
30. In Project Management, Controlling is critical if we are to use our limited resources wisely. 
True
31. If you can't measure it, you can't manage it. 
True
32. A project manager is proactive and not reactive. 
True
33. For most types of systems, the majority of costs are the costs of changing the software after it has gone into use. 
True
34. Program and Project are the same.
False Program and project are not the same. A program is a specific software application or system that performs a set of predefined functions. 
A project, on the other hand, is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. A project may involve the development of multiple programs.
